# Reading APP

This is a practice Flask project for learning the modular architecture
using **Blueprints**.

What did I learn:
- Application factory pattern
- Blueprint structure for modular routes
- Minimal templates
- Prepared for database integration (models.py)
- Safe configuration via .env file

Purpose: learning scalable Flask architecture and keep code modular
